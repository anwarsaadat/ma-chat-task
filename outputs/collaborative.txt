Comparison:
Layers of perceptrons; good for tabular data and simple patterns. Weight sharing and local receptive fields; strong for images and spatial data. Sequence models capturing temporal dependencies; LSTM/GRU mitigate vanishing gradients. Self-attention based; parallelizable; state of the art in language. Adaptive methods with momentum; strong default for many deep models. SGD, Momentum, Nesterov;...
