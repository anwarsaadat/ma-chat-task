User: What did we discuss about neural networks earlier?

Manager:
Here's what I found in memory:
- What, main, types, neural, networks: Main findings:
- Feedforward Neural Networks (MLP): Layers of perceptrons; good for tabular data and simple patterns.
- Convolutional Neural... (conf=1.0)
- Research, transformer, architectures, analyze, their, computational: Transformer Efficiency (heuristic):
- Transformers: Full (O(n^2)) | efficiencyâ‰ˆ0.6
Summary: Estimated efficiency from attention pattern heur... (conf=1.0)
