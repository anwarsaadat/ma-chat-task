User: What are the main types of neural networks?

Manager:
Main findings:
- Feedforward Neural Networks (MLP): Layers of perceptrons; good for tabular data and simple patterns.
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Weight sharing and local receptive fields; strong for images and spatial data.
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN, LSTM, GRU): Sequence models capturing temporal dependencies; LSTM/GRU mitigate vanishing gradients.
