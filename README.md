# Multi-Agent Task Orchestration System

This repository contains a modular multi-agent orchestration system designed for collaborative task execution, memory persistence, and adaptive reasoning. The system leverages Docker for portability and includes optional integration with LLMs (Groq or others).

---

## 🚀 Architecture Overview

The system consists of three main layers:

1. **Orchestrator (Coordinator)**  
   - Routes tasks to specialized agents.  
   - Handles dependency resolution and workflow sequencing.  
   - Ensures logs and decision traces are captured.

2. **Agents (Specialized Workers)**  
   - **Classifier Agent** → Categorizes tasks.  
   - **Executor Agent** → Runs actions, retrieves or computes results.  
   - **Summarizer Agent** → Synthesizes outputs for reporting.  

3. **Memory Layer (Persistence & Retrieval)**  
   - Task results are stored in a structured SQLite database.  
   - Retrieval queries are agent-aware for adaptive reuse.  
   - Includes fallback to rule-based search if LLM is unavailable.

## 🧠 Memory Design & Retrieval

- **Database**: SQLite (lightweight, portable).
- **Schema**:
  - `tasks (id, type, input, output, timestamp)`
- **Retrieval Strategy**:
  - Recent matching tasks are retrieved first.  
  - Agents adaptively reuse results where applicable.  
  - If LLM is configured → semantic retrieval.  
  - If LLM unavailable → rule-based keyword matching.

---

## 🤖 LLM Integration (Optional)

- **Provider**: [Groq](https://console.groq.com/docs/overview) Free Developer Tier.  
- **Usage**:
  - Classification  
  - Summarization  
  - Task Decomposition  

**Fallback**:  
If the LLM is unavailable, the system switches to rule-based logic to ensure uninterrupted functionality.

## 🌍 Portability

Since the system is fully containerized with **Docker**, it runs consistently across any environment that supports Docker:
- Linux
- macOS
- Windows (via WSL2 or Docker Desktop)

This ensures **reproducibility anywhere in the world**.

---

## 📜 Logs & Traceability

- Logs are automatically generated for:
  - Task submissions
  - Agent routing
  - Memory retrievals
  - Errors/fallback events
- Logs are stored in `outputs/` with scenario-specific identifiers.

---

## ✅ Evaluation Criteria Coverage

- **Memory Design** → SQLite schema with structured retrieval and fallbacks.  
- **Agent Coordination** → Orchestrator directs flow; agents execute specialized tasks.  
- **Autonomous Reasoning** → Adaptive fallback and memory reuse.  
- **Code Quality** → Modular, documented, containerized.  
- **Traceability** → Logging and decision traces.  
- **Repository Hygiene** → Includes README, Makefile, and logs in `outputs/`.
